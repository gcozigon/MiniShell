# MiniSell

Minishell is a project that involves building a simple Unix shell from scratch. The objective is to recreate a basic command-line interface where users can input commands, execute programs, handle signals, and manage processes, just like in a real shell. The project requires implementing features such as pipes, redirection, environment variables, and handling multiple commands.
